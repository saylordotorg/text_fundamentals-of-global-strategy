<span class="title-prefix">9.2</span> Supply-Chain Management</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="dekluyverglobstrat_1.0-ch09_s02_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Supply-chain management (SCM)</a><span class="glossdef">The total business-process concept of capturing synergies by attaining excellence in integrating and managing a firm’s network of relationships among and between all of its supply chain members.</span></span> has three principal components: (a) creating the <em class="emphasis">supply-chain network structure</em>, (b) developing <em class="emphasis">supply-chain business processes</em>, and (c) <em class="emphasis">managing the supply-chain activities</em>.<span class="footnote" id="dekluyverglobstrat_1.0-fn09_004">Lambert and Cooper (2000, January).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="dekluyverglobstrat_1.0-ch09_s02_p02">The <em class="emphasis">supply-chain network structure</em> consists of the member firms and the links between these firms. Primary <em class="emphasis">members</em> of a supply chain include all autonomous companies or strategic business units that carry out value-adding activities in the business processes designed to produce a specific output for a particular customer or market. Supporting members are companies that simply provide resources, knowledge, utilities, or assets for the primary members of the supply chain. For example, supporting companies include those that lease trucks to a manufacturer, banks that lend money to a retailer, or companies that supply production equipment, print marketing brochures, or provide administrative assistance.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="dekluyverglobstrat_1.0-ch09_s02_p03">Supply chains have three <em class="emphasis">structural dimensions</em>: horizontal, vertical, and the horizontal position of the focal company within the end points of the supply chain. The first dimension, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">horizontal structure</a><span class="glossdef">The dimension of a supply chain that refers to the number of tiers across the supply chain.</span></span>, refers to the number of tiers across the supply chain. The supply chain may be long, with numerous tiers, or short, with few tiers. As an example, the network structure for bulk cement is relatively short. Raw materials are taken from the ground, combined with other materials, moved a short distance, and used to construct buildings. The second dimension, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">vertical structure</a><span class="glossdef">The dimension of a supply chain that refers to the number of suppliers or customers represented within each tier.</span></span>, refers to the number of suppliers or customers represented within each tier. A company can have a narrow vertical structure, with few companies at each tier level, or a wide vertical structure with many suppliers or customers at each tier level. The third structural dimension is the company’s <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">horizontal position</a><span class="glossdef">The position that a firm occupies within the overall supply chain.</span></span> within the supply chain. A company can be positioned at or near the initial source of supply, be at or near to the ultimate customer, or be somewhere between these end points of the supply chain.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="dekluyverglobstrat_1.0-ch09_s02_p04"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Business processes</a><span class="glossdef">Activities that produce a specific output of value to the customer.</span></span> are the activities that produce a specific output of value to the customer. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">management function</a><span class="glossdef">Integrates key business processes and functions across the supply chain into an effective value delivery network.</span></span> integrates the business processes across the supply chain. Traditionally, in many companies, upstream and downstream portions of the supply chain were not effectively integrated. Today, competitive advantage increasingly depends on integrating eight key supply-chain processes—customer relationship management, customer service management, demand management, order fulfillment, manufacturing flow management, procurement, product development and commercialization, and managing returns—into an effective value delivery network.<span class="footnote" id="dekluyverglobstrat_1.0-fn09_005">Lambert , Guinipero, and Ridenhower (1998).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="dekluyverglobstrat_1.0-ch09_s02_p05">Regarding the supply-chain management function itself, in some companies, management emphasizes a functional structure, others a process structure, and yet others a combined structure of processes and functions. The number of business processes that it is critical or beneficial to integrate and manage between companies will likely vary. In some cases, it may be appropriate to link just one key process, and, in other cases, it may be appropriate to link multiple or all the key business processes. However, in each specific case, it is important that executives thoroughly analyze and discuss which key business processes to integrate and manage. With the shift from the traditional “push” to the modern “pull” model, supply-chain management has changed—the integration of e-commerce has produced (a) greater cost efficiency, (b) distribution flexibility, (c) better customer service, and (d) the ability to track and monitor shipments.</p>
