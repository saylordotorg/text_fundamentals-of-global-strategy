        <li>Every company has a <em class="emphasis">core  domestic strategy</em>, although it may not always be explicitly articulated.</li>
        <li>A <em class="emphasis">business model</em> is therefore simply a description of how a company does business. It describes who its customers are and how it reaches them and relates to them (<em class="emphasis">market participation</em>); what a company offers its customers (<em class="emphasis">the value proposition</em>); with what resources, activities, and partners it creates its offerings (<em class="emphasis">value chain infrastructure</em>); and, finally, how it organizes its operations (<em class="emphasis">implementation model</em>).</li>
        <li>Competitive advantage is increasingly achieved through focused and innovative business models.</li>
        <li>Crafting a global strategy is about deciding how a company should change or adapt its core (domestic) business model to achieve a competitive advantage as the firm globalizes its operations.</li>
        <li>A business model is shaped by a company’s underlying value creation strategy or <em class="emphasis">value discipline</em>. A value discipline is a statement of strategic focus and provides a context for a company to set its corporate vision and objectives, to target its most profitable customers, and to focus and align its activities.</li>
        <li>Three generic value disciplines are <em class="emphasis">operational excellence</em>, <em class="emphasis">customer intimacy</em>, and <em class="emphasis">product leadership</em>. A strategy of <em class="emphasis">operational excellence</em> is defined by a relentless focus on providing customers with reliable products or services at competitive prices and delivered with minimal difficulty or inconvenience. A focus on <em class="emphasis">customer intimacy</em>, the second value discipline, means segmenting and targeting markets precisely and then tailoring offerings to match exactly the demands of those niches. And <em class="emphasis">product leadership</em>, the third discipline, means offering customers leading-edge products and services that consistently enhance the customer’s use or application of the product, thereby making rivals’ goods obsolete.</li>
        <li>Choosing a value discipline and selecting a particular set of customers to serve are two sides of the same coin.</li>
        <li>Companies that push the boundaries of one value discipline while meeting industry standards in the other two often gain a significant lead—one that competitors have difficulty overcoming.</li>
