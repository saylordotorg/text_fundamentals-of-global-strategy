<span class="title-prefix">6.4</span> Combining Adaptation and Arbitrage: Global Product Development</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="dekluyverglobstrat_1.0-ch06_s04_p01">Globalization pressures have changed the practice of product development (PD) in many industries in recent years.<span class="footnote" id="dekluyverglobstrat_1.0-fn06_006">Eppinger and Chitkara (2006).</span> Rather than using a centralized or local cross-functional model, companies are moving to a mode of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">global collaboration</a><span class="glossdef">Describes how skilled development teams that are dispersed around the world collaborate to develop new products.</span></span> in which skilled development teams dispersed around the world collaborate to develop new products. Today, a majority of global corporations have engineering and development operations outside of their home region. China and India offer particularly attractive opportunities: Microsoft, Cisco, and Intel all have made major investments there.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="dekluyverglobstrat_1.0-ch06_s04_p02">The old model was based on the premise that <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">colocation</a><span class="glossdef">The centralized location of cross-functional teams in corporate research and product development centers to facilitate their close collaboration with other organizational units.</span></span> of cross-functional teams to facilitate close collaboration among engineering, marketing, manufacturing, and supply-chain functions was critical to effective product development. Colocated PD teams were thought to be more effective at concurrently executing the full range of activities involved, from understanding market and customer needs through conceptual and detailed design, testing, analysis, prototyping, manufacturing engineering, and technical product support and engineering. Such colocated concurrent practices were thought to result in better product designs, faster time to market, and lower-cost production. They were generally located in corporate research and development centers, which maintained linkages to manufacturing sites and sales offices around the world.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="dekluyverglobstrat_1.0-ch06_s04_p03">Today, best practice emphasizes a highly distributed, networked, and digitally supported development process. The resulting global product development process combines centralized functions with regionally distributed engineering and other development functions. It often involves outsourced engineering work as well as captive offshore engineering. The benefits of this distributed model include greater engineering efficiency (through utilization of <em class="emphasis">lower-cost</em> resources), <em class="emphasis">access to technical expertise</em> internationally, more <em class="emphasis">global input to product design</em>, and greater <em class="emphasis">strategic flexibility</em>.</p>
