<span class="title-prefix">8.1</span> Core Competencies</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="dekluyverglobstrat_1.0-ch08_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Core competencies</a><span class="glossdef">Unique capabilities that allow a firm to build a competitive advantage.</span></span> represent unique capabilities that allow a company to build a competitive advantage. 3M has developed a core competency in coatings. Canon has core competencies in optics, imaging, and microprocessor controls. Procter &amp; Gamble’s marketing prowess allows it to adapt more quickly than its rivals to changing opportunities. The development of core competencies has become a key element in building a long-term strategic advantage. An evaluation of strategic resources and capabilities must therefore include assessments of the core competencies a company has or is developing, how they are nurtured, and how they can be leveraged.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="dekluyverglobstrat_1.0-ch08_s01_p02">Core competencies evolve as a firm develops its business model and incorporates its intellectual assets. Core competencies are not just things a company does particularly well; rather, they are sets of skills or systems that create a uniquely high value for customers at best-in-class levels. To qualify, such skills or systems should contribute to perceived customer benefits, be difficult for competitors to imitate, and allow for leverage across markets. Honda’s use of small engine technology in a variety of products—including motorcycles, jet skis, and lawn mowers—is a good example.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="dekluyverglobstrat_1.0-ch08_s01_p03">Core competencies should be focused on creating value and should be adapted as customer requirements change. Targeting a carefully selected set of core competencies also benefits innovation. Charles Schwab, for example, successfully leveraged its core competency in brokerage services by expanding its client communication methods to include Internet, telephone, offices, and financial advisors.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="dekluyverglobstrat_1.0-ch08_s01_p04">Hamel and Prahalad suggest three tests for identifying core competencies. First, core competencies should provide access to a broad array of markets. Second, they should help differentiate core products and services. Third, core competencies should be hard to imitate because they represent multiple skills, technologies, and organizational elements.<span class="footnote" id="dekluyverglobstrat_1.0-fn08_001">Prahalad and Hamel (1990, May/June).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="dekluyverglobstrat_1.0-ch08_s01_p05">Experience shows that only a few companies have the resources to develop more than a handful of core competencies. Picking the right ones, therefore, is the key. A key question to ask is, which resources or capabilities should be kept in-house and developed into core competencies and which ones should be outsourced? Pharmaceutical companies, for example, increasingly outsource clinical testing in an effort to focus their resource base on drug development. Generally, the development of core competencies should focus on long-term platforms capable of adapting to new market circumstances; on unique sources of leverage in the value chain in which the firm thinks it can dominate; on elements that are important to customers in the long run; and on key skills and knowledge, not on products.</p>
